It has two primary components: Ensmallen, which handles graph processing, and Embiggen, which produces embeddings. Working with large, complex graphs can be very computationally intensive, so the GraPE tools use a variety of strategies to optimize efficiency. They also work very well with KG-Hub graphs!\n",
