Two are ontologies available through the KG-OBO project on KG-Hub: FOODON, a food ontology, and CHEBI, a chemical ontology. The other sources are sets of preprocessed [Reactome](https://reactome.org) pathways, connections between those pathways, and mappings between those pathways and chemicals. They're all defined in a dictionary below, with the name of each source as its key and a list of one or more source URLs as its value. We've also defined a set of local filenames, as we know what the compressed ontology files should contain."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"Dp81ZNcvb5Qn","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":121,"status":"ok","timestamp":1654291963120,"user":{"displayName":"Harry Caufield","userId":"03176428528134146285"},"user_tz":240},"id":"Dp81ZNcvb5Qn"},"outputs":[],"source":["data_dir = \"./\" # Just the current directory, though in practice it would be something like data/raw/\n","sources = {\"foodon\":[\"https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-obo/foodon/2022-02-01/foodon_kgx_tsv.tar.gz\"],\n","           \"chebi\":[\"https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-obo/chebi/210/chebi_kgx_tsv.tar.gz\"],\n","           \"chebi2reactome\":[\"https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-idg/20220601/transformed/reactome/chebi2reactome_edges.tsv\",\n","                             \"https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-idg/20220601/transformed/reactome/chebi2reactome_nodes.tsv\"],\n","           \"reactome_pathways\":[\"https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-idg/20220601/transformed/reactome/reactomepathways_nodes.tsv\"],\n","           \"reactome_relations\":[\"https://kg-hub.berkeleybop.io/kg-idg/20220601/transformed/reactome/reactomepathwaysrelation_edges.tsv\"]}\n","local_filepaths = {\"foodon\":[\"foodon_kgx_tsv_edges.tsv\",\n","                            \"foodon_kgx_tsv_nodes.tsv\"],\n","           \"chebi\":[\"chebi_kgx_tsv_edges.tsv\",\n","                    \"chebi_kgx_tsv_nodes.tsv\"],\n","           \"chebi2reactome\":[\"chebi2reactome_edges.tsv\",\n","                             \"chebi2reactome_nodes.tsv\"],\n","           \"reactome_pathways\":[\"reactomepathways_nodes.tsv\"],\n","           \"reactome_relations\":[\"reactomepathwaysrelation_edges.tsv\"]}"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"jpdRBj8afOrE","metadata":{"id":"jpdRBj8afOrE"},"source":["There is an example of a KGX download config file [here](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-dtm-template/blob/master/download.yaml), but it's easy to assemble from scratch with something like the following:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"id":"pynXk66VfaOt","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":130,"status":"ok","timestamp":1654292390036,"user":{"displayName":"Harry Caufield","userId":"03176428528134146285"},"user_tz":240},"id":"pynXk66VfaOt"},"outputs":[],"source":["source_data = []\n","for source in sources:\n","  for url in sources[source]:\n","    local_name = url.rpartition('/')[-1]\n","    source_data.append({\"url\":url,\n","                        \"local_name\":local_name})\n","\n","with open(\"download.yaml\", \"w\") as dl_config:\n","  yaml.dump(source_data, dl_config, default_flow_style=False)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"H_UK6orMgwuc","metadata":{"id":"H_UK6orMgwuc"},"source":["Now we may use the config file with the `kghub-downloader` to download all sources."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"7L1P6k8tg3a4","metadata":{"id":"7L1P6k8tg3a4"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/bin/bash: downloader: command not found\n"]}],"source":["!downloader download.yaml"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"91bf36cf","metadata":{},"source":["Decompress the compressed sources."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"5c89c0f6","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["chebi_kgx_tsv_nodes.tsv\n","chebi_kgx_tsv_edges.tsv\n","foodon_kgx_tsv_nodes.tsv\n","foodon_kgx_tsv_edges.tsv\n"]}],"source":["!cat *.tar.gz | tar zxvf - -i"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5e7f7b89","metadata":{},"source":["Next step: set up a merge config file.
